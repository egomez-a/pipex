# pipex

My version of the Pipex project at 42 school to implement the shell commands "|" and ">" in C.

To execute please type make and then execute ./pipex infile "command1 flags1" "command2 flags2" outfile

The project replicates the behaviour of < infile command1 flags1 | command2 flags2 > outfile in shell

This project has been successfully done with all mandatory tasks with 0 leaks.
